\title{generate an integrated ligand-receptor interaction matrix}
\usage{
generate_LRintegratedmatrix(
  whoisneighbor,
  neighbor_geneexp,
  center_geneexp,
  center_is_ligand
)
}
\arguments{
\item{whoisneighbor}{A square numeric matrix indicating spatial neighborhood relationships.
Rows and columns correspond to spatial spots (barcodes), where non-zero
values indicate neighboring relationships. The row and column names must be
identical and ordered consistently with the gene expression matrices.}

\item{neighbor_geneexp}{A matrix with rows representing spatial spots and columns representing genes.}

\item{center_geneexp}{A matrix with rows representing spatial spots and columns representing genes.}

\item{center_is_ligand}{A logical value specifying the signaling role of the center spots.
\itemize{
\item \code{TRUE}: center spots are treated as ligand-expressing cells,
and neighboring spots as receptor-expressing cells.
\item \code{FALSE}: center spots are treated as receptor-expressing cells,
and neighboring spots as ligand-expressing cells.
}}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with rows representing micro-regions (defined by a center spot
and its neighbors) and columns representing ligand–receptor gene pairs.
Each entry corresponds to the element-wise product of mean neighbor gene
expression and center spot gene expression for a given ligand–receptor pair.
}
\description{
For each spatial view (e.g., view1 and view2), this function is executed twice
to capture bidirectional ligand–receptor signaling between center spots and
their neighboring spots.
Specifically, center spots and neighbor spots can alternately act as signal
senders and receivers:
\itemize{
\item If the center spot expresses ligands, neighboring spots express receptors.
\item Conversely, if the center spot expresses receptors, neighboring spots express ligands.
}
