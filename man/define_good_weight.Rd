\title{define_good_weight: define adaptive weights based on reconstruction error}
\usage{
define_good_weight(X, Wzero, Hzero, theta_v, weight_input)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A list of numeric matrices. Each matrix represents an observed data matrix to be factorized.}

\item{Wzero}{Wzero}

\item{Hzero}{Hzero}

\item{theta_v}{A numeric vector of initial weights for each matrix.}

\item{weight_input}{A numeric vector specifying the target or prior weights for each matrix.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of adaptive weights, with length equal to length(X).
}
\description{
This function computes an adaptive weight for each matrix based on
its reconstruction error under a given matrix factorization.
