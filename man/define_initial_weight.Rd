\title{define_initial_weight: define initial weights for a list of matrices}
\usage{
define_initial_weight(data.list)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.list}{A list of numeric matrices.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of weights, with length equal to length(data.list).
}
\description{
This function computes an initial weight for each matrix in a list
based on its Frobenius norm and matrix size. The weights are designed
to balance the contribution of matrices with different scales and
dimensions in downstream joint or multi-modal analyses.
