\title{Calculate Moran's I for spatial ligand-receptor integrated matrix}
\usage{
moransi_for_LRintegratedmatrix(LRintegratedmatrix, spatial.seu, cc_interaction)
}
\arguments{
\item{LRintegratedmatrix}{A numeric matrix of integrated LR interaction
scores. Rows correspond to LR interactions and columns correspond to
spatial spots. Row names represent interaction identifiers.
Underscores ('_') in row names will be replaced by hyphens ('-') to ensure
consistency with Seurat's feature naming conventions.}

\item{spatial.seu}{A Seurat object containing spatial transcriptomics data.
This object must include spatial image information (e.g. Visium) and
spot coordinates. Column names of LRintegratedmatrix must match
the spot names in this object.}

\item{cc_interaction}{A data frame containing ligand–receptor interaction
annotations.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing Moran's I statistics for spatially variable
ligand–receptor interactions, merged with ligand–receptor annotation
information. The output is sorted by decreasing observed Moran's I.
